# Theme: 
our game aims to achieve the theme nearby in space but distant in time by making a game set in the familiar space of a restaurant that makes sushi, but in a distant time in the future

# selectable requirements:
the three selectable requirements we chose were Data-driven experience progression, Advanced visual assets, and Procedural audio.
For procedural audio, we used Tone.js to randomly generate music as you are playing, helping create an eerie atmosphere, and furthering our theme.

# assets:
all assets were created by Collette Harrison using procreate
