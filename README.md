# Scene Flow Prototype 
## Scene types: Your prototype should demonstrate how at least four kinds of distinct types of scenes are used in your game.

### Includes folllowing scenes: Cinematic, Menu, Gameplay, Results, Credits.

## Communication between scenes: The choices that players made on one scene must have some impact on the appearance of other screens.

### Has global object(game.data) that includes the current day/level variable. Pressing 'start next day' on the Result screen increments the current day variable. This variable change can be seen in the Gameplay scene.

## Reachability: All important scenes must be reachable in the scene flow prototype.

### All scenes are accessible. For example, there are two buttons on the Menu scene. One goes to Gameplay scene, the other goes to Credits scene.

## Transitions: The scene flow prototype must demonstrate the use of at least one kind of fancy transition that is appropriate to your game design.

### We have a coordinated fade to black and from black in between scenes.
