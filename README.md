# Scene Flow Prototype 
_Scene types: Your prototype should demonstrate how at least four kinds of distinct types of scenes are used in your game
_
    Includes the following scenes: Cinematic, Menu, Gameplay, Results, Credits. 


_Communication between scenes: The choices that players made on one scene must have some impact on the appearance of other screens._

    Has global object(game.data) that includes the current day/level variable. 
    Pressing 'start next day' on the Result screen increments the current day variable. 
    This variable change can be seen in the Gameplay scene.

_Reachability: All important scenes must be reachable in the scene flow prototype._

    All scenes are accessible. For example, there are two buttons on the Menu scene. 
    One goes to Gameplay scene, the other goes to Credits scene.

_Transitions: The scene flow prototype must demonstrate the use of at least one kind of fancy transition that is appropriate to your game design._

    We have a coordinated fade to black and from black in between scenes.
